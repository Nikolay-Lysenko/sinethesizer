# This is an example of mapping MIDI instrument IDs to instruments from `sinethesizer` preset.
0: sine_with_three_partials  # So 'Acoustic Grand Piano' is played as 'sine_with_three_partials'.
43: sine_with_user_defined_envelope  # So 'Cello' is played as 'sine_with_user_defined_envelope'.

# If an instrument is used in a MIDI file, but is absent in a mapping file, attempt to play the MIDI file will fail.
