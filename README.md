# [Sine]thesizer

## Overview

It is a digital additive synthesizer that provides a flexible way to create new virtual instruments with their own timbres.

The list of implemented and planned features is as follows:
- [x] Balance between freedom for user and simplicity of input formats
- [x] Stereo sound
- [x] Sound effects (e.g., vibrato, overdrive, phaser, etc)
- [x] Partial support of subtractive synthesis and FM synthesis
- [ ] Noises and drums
- [ ] Rich collection of presets

## Installation

To install a stable version, run:
```
pip install sinethesizer
```

## Usage

This synthesizer converts text files with parameters of sound events to WAV files with resulting audio tracks. It can be done with the following command:
```
python -m sinethesizer -i path/to/track.tsv -p path/to/presets.yml -o path/to/output.wav
```

Below table provides links to detailed information about input files that are required from user.
